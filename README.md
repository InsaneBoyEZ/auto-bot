Created a barebones Discord Bot using the [DigitalOcean Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-discord-bot-with-node-js).

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Create a ```config.json``` in the project directory:    

```json

{
  "BOT_TOKEN":""
}

```    

Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application and bot. Save the bot token in ```config.json```.

### Scripts

```npm install``` node dependencies.    

```npm run dev``` during development.    

```npm start``` during production/delpoyment.
